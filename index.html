<h2>Quote of the day:</h2>

<div> "There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all..." -The Beatles""</div>

					<h2>Seattle, WA              </h2>
					<p>From age 5 to 18 I live in a suburb on the far southrn edge of the St. Louis metropolitan area. It was just what you probably expect: subdivisions, baseball teams, big box stores, and lots of TV. Most of my fond memories from these years involve my family. Pictured here are my brother, mother, and grandfather.</p>

					<h2>Amsterdam, NY</h2>
					<p>In the summer of 2003, I lived in this small town about halfway between Grand Rapids and Lake Michigan. Summers in Michagans are a dream, with their long days, relatively mild temps, and plenty of outdoor recreation at close access.</p>
